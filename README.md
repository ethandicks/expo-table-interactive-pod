Tabletop demo selector for VCF and MakerFaires

# Overview #

This project provides electrical, physical, and software designs for a small table-top keypad to allow visitors to select from a limited number of selections (3-5) of pre-coded demo programs.  It provides for two DE9 serial ports to control a retail POS pole display and a dumb terminal.  The dumb terminal port can also be used to simply pass on a serial message to another part of the exhibit if simple terminal output is not required.

# Major Components #

* 3D printed plastic or sheet metal mounting frame
* Microcontroller module (e.g., Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, Arduino)
* 1-2 RS-232 level shifters w/DE-9 connectors
* 3-5 Cherry MX-style keyboard switches with square panel mount tabs
* Retail POS VFD Pole Display
* Dumb terminal (VT100, et al)
* Power supply for micro controller, serial cables, MX keycaps, etc.
